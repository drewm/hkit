#summary Road Map towards future releases

This is a very basic and preliminary road map as we head towards a version 1.0 release of hkit.

= Version 1.0 =

These are the primary objectives that need to be fulfilled to reach hkit version 1.

  * Solid hCard implementation (pass all tests: http://microformats.org/tests/hcard/)
  * Support for XFN, minimum rel="me"
  * Support for multiple class instances within a script
  * User documentation for creating format profiles
  * Remote document caching

= Immediately beyond 1.0 =

  * hReview implementation (pass all tests: http://microformats.org/tests/hreview/)
  * hCalendar implementation (when tests become available)
  * Support for parsing for multiple compound microformats at once (e.g. hCard within an hReview)
