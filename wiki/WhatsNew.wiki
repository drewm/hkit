== New since release 0.5 ==

  * `loadURL()` method now uses cURL in preference when fetching remote documents. This also enables the following of HTTP Location headers.

    * aim:
    * ymsgr:
    * skype:
    * msnim:
    * im:
    * webcal:
    * xmpp:
  * changed interface so that a numeric array of results is aways returned - even for one result - thanks Ueli Weiss

  * improved matching for redundant whitespace
  * improved unicode support in implied n optimization rules for hCard profile
